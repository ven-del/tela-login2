                <p>The year is 21XX. It is a world where humans coexist with advanced robots. These robots are known as Reploids, and have completely human thought processes. Robots with faulty electronic brains are called Mavericks, and the Reploids used to control them are called Maverick Hunters. Their mission is to find and eliminate all Mavericks that harm humans or Reploids. X is a member of the Maverick Hunters. Sigma, the captain of the 17th Unit to which X belongs, is known as the strongest of all Maverick Hunters, and on top of that, has an excellent electronic brain. But one day, he gave an order to all Reploids: "Eradicate the humans! They are our enemy! Kill them all!" With this call, many Reploids began to rampage, and an intense rebellion began... The battle reaches its fever pitch with the addition of Zero, a friend with whom X shares a mysterious bond. Fight, Mega Man X! Show no mercy to Sigma's rebellion!</p>
